# devlanes-proto

## 0.4.0 — 2026-10-25

### Minor changes

- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Removed the fnox integration: the `fnox` config key and `devlanes secrets unlock`.
  
  Configs with a `fnox:` key fail to load. Run the tool in the command instead, for example `fnox exec -- npm run dev`. `${{ env.X }}` now reads the client environment, then `.env`.

### Patch changes

- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Changed TUI lane chips to show the lane's branch, with `@N` only when two lanes share a name. An extra lane on the same folder shows its own name.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Added a per-core CPU view to the TUI monitor. `m` puts memory in the large graph box and CPU in a small box with a square per core, and `c` switches back.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Added `devlanes remote connect` on Windows, using the OpenSSH client in System32 or on `PATH`. Boxes stay Linux or macOS.
  
  Passphrase prompts are relayed to the terminal. Names Windows can't hold are skipped and listed as sync issues. Running the OpenSSH Authentication Agent service avoids a prompt on every reconnect. See `docs/guides/remote-setup.md`.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Added the `infra.hosts` URLs of a container to `devlanes status` and the TUI container pane.
