### Patch changes

- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Fixed remote sync overwriting files on case-insensitive folders when the box has names that differ only by case. Those names are skipped and listed as sync issues.
- [771b030](https://github.com/devlanes-run/devlanes/commit/771b030878fefcde77a4d3b35bd007c17c9b9b30) Added `devlanes remote connect` on Windows, using the OpenSSH client in System32 or on `PATH`. Boxes stay Linux or macOS.
  
  Passphrase prompts are relayed to the terminal. Names Windows can't hold are skipped and listed as sync issues. Running the OpenSSH Authentication Agent service avoids a prompt on every reconnect. See `docs/guides/remote-setup.md`.
